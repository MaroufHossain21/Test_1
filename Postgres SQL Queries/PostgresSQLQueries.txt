1. How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named 'David Farrell'?
select starttime
from cd.bookings
inner join cd.members on cd.members.memid = cd.bookings.memid
where surname like ‘%Farrell%’ and firstname like %David%'
order by starttime;


2.How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts, for the date '2012-09-21'? Return a list of start time and facility name pairings, ordered by the time.
select starttime, name
From cd.bookings
Inner join  cd.facilities on cd.facilities.facid = cd.bookings.facid
Where name like '%Tennis Court%' and starttime BETWEEN '2012-09-21 00:00:00' and ‘2012-09-21 23:59:59'
Order by starttime;

3.
select distinct recs.firstname as firstname, recs.surname as surname
from cd.members mems
inner join cd.members recs
on recs.memid = mems.recommendedby
order bysurname, firstname;

4.How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any)? Ensure that results are ordered by (surname, firstname)
select mems.firstname as memfname, mems.surname as memsname, recs.firstname as recfname, recs.surname as recsname
from cd.members mems
left outer join cd.members recs
on recs.memid = mems.recommendedby
order by memsname, memfname;

5. How can you produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court? Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by the member name

select distinct mems.firstname || ' ' || mems.surname as member, facs.name as facility
from
cd.members mems
inner join cd.bookings bks
on mems.memid = bks.memid
inner join cd.facilities facs
on bks.facid = facs.facid
where bks.facid in (0,1)
Order by member

6. How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30? Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is always ID 0. Include in your output the name of the facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost. Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries.

Select mems.firstname || ' ' || mems.surname as member,
facs.name as facility, case when mems.memid = 0 then
bks.slots*facs.guestcost
else
bks.slots*facs.membercost end as cost
from
cd.members mems inner join cd.bookings bks
on mems.memid = bks.memid inner join cd.facilities facs
on bks.facid = facs.facid
where
bks.starttime >= '2012-09-14' and
bks.starttime < '2012-09-15' and (
(mems.memid = 0 and bks.slots*facs.guestcost > 30) or
(mems.memid != 0 and bks.slots*facs.membercost > 30)
)
order by cost desc;

7. How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any), without using any joins? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that each firstname + surname pairing is formatted as a column and ordered.

select distinct mems.firstname || ' ' ||  mems.surname as member,
(select recs.firstname || ' ' || recs.surname as recommender
from cd.members recs where recs.memid = mems.recommendedby 	)
from
cd.members mems order by member
